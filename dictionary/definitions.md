# Definitions

## _Accessibility_ <a id="accessibility"></a>

Basically, this is the ability of a website to be used by people with disabilities, including visually impaired visitors using screen readers, hearing impaired visitors using no sound, color blind people, or those with other disabilities. A website with low accessibility is basically going to be impossible for those with disabilities to use. Accessibility is particularly important for sites providing information to those with disabilities \(healthcare sites, government sites, etc.\), though it is an important aspect to consider when designing any site.

## _AJAX_ <a id="ajax"></a>

Stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is typically used for creating dynamic web applications and allows for asynchronous data retrieval without having to reload the page a visitor is on. The JavaScript on a given page handles most of the basic functions of the application, making it perform more like a desktop program instead of a web-based one.

## _API \(Application Program Interface\)_ <a id="api-application-program-interface"></a>

* A set of functions, procedures, methods or classes used by computer programs to request services from the operating system, software libraries or any other service providers running on the computer. A computer programmer uses the API to make application programs. Types of API include web services API like the Twitter API, which allows programs to use the API to receive updates on tweets.

## _Argument_ <a id="argument"></a>

* The actual value passed in to a function or method. See also: Params.

## _ASP.NET_ <a id="asp-net"></a>

ASP.NET is a server-side web application framework that is designed for web development. It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic websites, web applications and web services. ASP.NET pages have a file extension of .aspx. These files typically contain HTML markup, as well as markup defining serverside web controls and user controls. This type of programming language is most commonly hosted on a Windows server

## _Async / Asynchronous_ <a id="async-asynchronous"></a>

* Means that a script will send a request to the server, and continue it's execution without waiting for the reply. As soon as reply is received a browser event is fired, which in turn allows the script to execute associated actions. [Further analogies.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4559032/easy-to-understand-definition-of-asynchronous-event)​

## _Callbacks \(Higher order functions\)_ <a id="callbacks-higher-order-functions"></a>

* A callback function, also known as a higher-order function, is a function that is passed to another function \(let's call this other function “otherFunction”\) as a parameter, and the callback function is called \(or executed\) inside the otherFunction. [More.](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/)​

## _Cache_ <a id="cache"></a>

Web cache is a mechanism for the temporary storage \(or caching\) of web documents to reduce bandwidth usage and server load. It lets you set aside a section of your computer’s hard disk to store representations that you’ve seen. As you jump from web page to web page, caching those pages in memory lets you quickly go back to a page without having to download it from the web again.

## _CLI \(command line interface\)_ <a id="cli-command-line-interface"></a>

* A user interface to a computer's operating system or an application in which the user responds to a visual prompt by typing in a command on a specified line, receives a response back from the system. Examples: Terminal, iTerm2, MS-DOS.

## _Client-Side_ <a id="client-side"></a>

Client-side refers to scripts that are run in a viewer’s browser, instead of on a web server \(as in server-side scripts\). Client-side scripts are generally faster to interact with, though they can take longer to load initially.

## _Compiled and interpreted languages_ <a id="compiled-and-interpreted-languages"></a>

Compiled languages \(like C, C++, and Swift\) require you to compile and build your code into a self-contained binary application before it can be distributed and run.

Interpreted languages \(like Python, PHP, and JavaScript\) are run by the language’s interpreter on the host machine by reading the code directly, and providing instructions to the computer to execute the program.

## _Content Management System \(CMS\)_ <a id="content-management-system-cms"></a>

A content management system \(CMS\) is a software system that provides website administration tools so users with little knowledge of web programming languages or markup languages can create and manage website content with relative ease. Examples of different types of CMS systems are ExpressionEngine, Wordpress, Joomla, Concrete5, and Drupal.

## _Closure_ <a id="closure"></a>

* A really confusing concept, A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer \(enclosing\) function's variables—scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope \(variables defined between its curly brackets\), it has access to the outer function's variables, and it has access to the global variables. More info.

## _Cross-origin/CORS/Xorigin_ <a id="cross-origin-cors-xorigin"></a>

* Cross-origin resource sharing \(CORS\) is a mechanism that allows resources \(e.g. fonts\) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the site on which that resource exists. If an AJAX request fails, there is a significant chance that CORS has been restricted for that site \(to not allow outside data requests\).

## _DNS_ <a id="dns"></a>

* DNS \(Domain Name Service\) is effectively the phonebook of the internet. It allows humans to search for sensible human domain name, instead of things like IP addresses. When you visit a site, the DNS finds the IP address assosciated with that URL and connects your computer.

## _Elastic Layout_ <a id="elastic-layout"></a>

An elastic layout is one that uses percentages and ems for widths paired with a max-width style to allow the site layout to stretch when font sizes are changed. It’s ability to flex to accommodate the browser width and reader’s font preferences are where it gets its name.

## _Encapsulation_ <a id="encapsulation"></a>

Is the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, e.g., a class in Java. This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state, of an object from the outside. This is called information hiding. The general idea of this mechanism is simple. If you have an attribute that is not visible from the outside of an object, and bundle it with methods that provide read or write access to it, then you can hide specific information and control access to the internal state of the object.

## _Hoisting_ <a id="hoisting"></a>

* Hoisting is Javascript's default behaviour, moving all declared variables to the top of the current scope before they've been assigned values. [Examples here.](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_hoisting.asp)​

## _IDE_ <a id="ide"></a>

Short for Integrated Development Environment, an IDE is a development tool \(or collection of tools\) used to develop for particular languages, including code editors, compilers, debuggers, and other utilities. Popular IDEs include Apple’s Xcode, Microsoft’s Visual Studio, and Java IDEs like IntelliJ, NetBeans, and Eclipse. Whatever your language, there’s an IDE for it.

## _Immutable_ <a id="immutable"></a>

* In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object \(unchangeable object\) is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

## _Inheritance_ <a id="inheritance"></a>

In object-oriented programming, inheritance enables new objects to take on the properties of existing objects. A class that is used as the basis for inheritance is called a superclass or base class. A class that inherits from a superclass is called a subclass or derived class. The terms parent class and child class are also acceptable terms to use respectively. A child inherits visible properties and methods from its parent while adding additional properties and methods of its own.

## _IP address_ <a id="ip-address"></a>

* An Internet Protocol Address is a unique address assigned to any decive on the web. It is the means by which machines locate one another. In much the same way we would use a web address \(like www.example.com\), machines use IP addresses.

## _Kernel_ <a id="kernel"></a>

Kernel, in computer technologies, is the central part in most computer operating systems for the management of the system's resources and the communication between hardware and software components. As a basic component of an operating system, a kernel provides abstraction layers for hardware, especially for memory, processors and I/O that allows hardware and software to communicate. It also provides software facilities to userland software such as process abstractions, inter-process communication and system calls. Kernel may also mean an essential subset of a programming language or core language, in terms of which other constructs are \(or could be\) defined.

## _Operators_ <a id="operators"></a>

* **Comparison operators** Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

  **Examples;**

  | Operator | Meaning | True Statements |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | == | Equality | 28 == '28', 28 == 28 |
  | === | Strict Equality | 28 === 28 |
  | != | Inequality | 28 != 27 |
  | !== | Strict Inequality | 28 !== 23 |
  | &gt; | Greater than | 28 &gt; 23 |
  | &gt;= | Greater than or Equal to | 28 &gt;= 28 |
  | &lt; | Less than | 24 &lt; 28 |
  | &lt;= | Less than or Equal to | 24 &lt;= 24 |

* **Logical operators** Logical operators are typically used with Boolean \(logical\) values. When they are, they return a Boolean value.

  | Operator | Meaning | True Expressions |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | && | AND | 4 &gt; 0 && 4 &lt; 10 |
  | \|\| | OR | 4 &gt; 0 \|\| 4 &lt; 3 |
  | ! | NOT | !\(4 &lt; 0\) |

## _Object-oriented programming \(OOP\)_ <a id="object-oriented-programming-oop"></a>

* Refers to a type of computer programming \(software design\) in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations \(functions\) that can be applied to the data structure.

## _Params / Parameters_ <a id="params-parameters"></a>

* The variable in a method/function definition `(var myFunction = function( iAmAParameter ){};)`. See also: Arguments.

## _Persistent Elements_ <a id="persistent-elements"></a>

Persistent elements are items that will appear in the header and footer of every page of your website site. These are the most important elements on the page, including the navigation. Most of the time, the action you’re hoping site visitors will take \(your primary conversion\) should be a persistent element

## _Polymorphism_ <a id="polymorphism"></a>

In a programming language that exhibits polymorphism, objects of classes belonging to the same hierarchical tree \(inherited from a common base class\) may possess functions bearing the same name, but each having different behaviors.

As an example, assume there is a base class named Animals from which the subclasses Horse, Fish and Bird are derived. Also assume that the Animals class has a function named Move, which is inherited by all subclasses mentioned. With polymorphism, each subclass may have its own way of implementing the function. So, for example, when the Move function is called in an object of the Horse class, the function might respond by displaying trotting on the screen. On the other hand, when the same function is called in an object of the Fish class, swimming might be displayed on the screen. In the case of a Bird object, it may be flying.

## _Primitive data types_ <a id="primitive-data-types"></a>

* A primitive \(primitive value, primitive data type\) is data that is not an object and has no methods. Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation. Javascript for instance, has 6 types:
  * Strings - things in quotes. `"I'm a string."`
  * Numbers - Raw number values. `1 2.3` \(not "1"\).
  * Booleans - `True False`
  * Null - A value that has been explicitly told it has no value.
  * Undefined - A value that has not been defined.
  * Symbols \(new in ECMAScript 2015\)

## _Promises_ <a id="promises"></a>

* Code that executes depending on the response of the code it's attached to. For instance `.done()` is a promise that will run once a task has been completed. [Further reading.](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-promise-27fc71e77261)​

## _Responsive Design_ <a id="responsive-design"></a>

A website created with responsive programming adapts and optimizes according the size of a user’s screen – from desktop to tablet to mobile device. The layout of the site is elastic – it stretches and enlarges to look great on large screens, and shrinks and shuffles to stack into a single column for small screens. With a single website, you can offer an optimal website browsing experience to every user. Responsive is superfriendly, and it’s the closest thing we have to future-proofing websites. Building a traditional, fixed-width website is obsolete.

## _Scope_ <a id="scope"></a>

* JS
  * JS
  * Global: A variable available to any code following the definition of that variable.
  * Local: A variable that is only available within that object.
  * Block: A variable only available between curly brackets.
* Ruby
  * Class variable \(@@a\_variable\): Available from the class definition and any sub-classes. Not available from anywhere outside.
  * Instance variable \(@a\_variable\): Available only within a specific object, across all methods in a class instance. Not available directly from class definitions.
  * Global variable \($a\_variable\): Available everywhere within your Ruby script.
  * Local variable \(a\_variable\): As above, available only within your method/loop etc.

## _Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\)_ <a id="secure-sockets-layer-ssl"></a>

Secure Sockets layer \(SSL\) is a security technology that allows an encrypted connection between you and a server. An SSL certificate contains the data your server will use for the encryption.

Typically, when you're sending data from one machine to another, it's sent as plain text. If your site sends vulnerable data \(such as passwords or credit card numbers\) without an SSL, that data could be intercepted by attackers. With SSL in place, the transmitted data is encrypted.

You can tell when a site is protected with an SSL by the green lock symbol next to the URL in your browser. The URL will also have an “S” \(which stands for secure\) after HTTP. If your website has a secure certificate, you’ll likely need dedicated hosting.

## _Server_ <a id="server"></a>

* A server is a computer program that provides services to other computer programs \(and their users\) in the same or other computers. The computer that a server program runs in is also frequently referred to as a server. That machine may be a dedicated server or used for other purposes as well.

## _Serverless_ <a id="serverless"></a>

Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model in which the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity. It is a form of utility computing.

Serverless computing still requires servers, hence it's a misnomer. The name "serverless computing" is used because the server management and capacity planning decisions are completely hidden from the developer or operator. Serverless code can be used in conjunction with code deployed in traditional styles, such as microservices. Alternatively, applications can be written to be purely serverless and use no provisioned servers at all.

## _Service-Oriented Architecture \(SOA\)_ <a id="service-oriented-architecture-soa"></a>

Service-Oriented Architecture expresses a perspective of software architecture that defines the use of services to support the requirements of software users. In an SOA environment, resources on a network are made available as independent services that can be accessed without knowledge of their underlying platform implementation. SOA is a style of multi-tier computing that helps organizations share logic and data among multiple applications and usage modes. A number of common terms have surfaced in association with structured service and SOA delivery processes:

* service-oriented analysis
* service-oriented design
* service-oriented analysis and design \(SOAD\)
* service-modeling
* service-oriented modeling
* service-oriented modeling and architecture \(SOMA\)

## _SOAP_ <a id="soap"></a>

Stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. It’s an XML-based protocol exchanging information across the internet to allow an application on one site to access an application or database on another site.

## _Strongly & Weakly typed languages_ <a id="strongly-and-weakly-typed-languages"></a>

* The difference between a strongly typed language and a weakly typed language is basically that a strongly typed language checks the type of a variable before performing an operation on it, whereas a weakly typed language does not. In addition, strongly typed languages require explicit casts, while weakly typed languages perform implicit casts.

## _undefined_ <a id="undefined"></a>

* A value that has no definition. You'll most often see this if you are trying to call or return a variable thai is either out of scope, or spelled incorrectly.

## _Version control_ <a id="version-control"></a>

A component of software configuration management, version control, also known as revision control or source control,\[1\] is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

## _XHR/XMLHttpRequest_ <a id="xhr-xmlhttprequest"></a>

* Abbreviated as XHR, XMLHttpRequest is a set of APIs that can be used by Web browser scripting languages, such as JavaScript to transfer XML and other text data to and from a Web server using HTTP.

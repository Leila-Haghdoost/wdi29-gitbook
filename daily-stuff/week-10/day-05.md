## simpleCov <a id="simplecov"></a>

#### What is it? <a id="what-is-it"></a>

SimpleCov is a gem which gives you detailed feedback on test coverage. It's a good way of understanding where and why you are lacking test coverage on your project.

#### Lets get started: <a id="lets-get-started"></a>

In our gemfile, in the test environment:

```ruby
gem 'simplecov', :require => 'false'
```

We add the `:require => false` because we want to invoke simpleCov manually.

If it runs immediately when the program starts, it will not give us valid feedback on our program's test coverage.

Next, run `bundle install` to actually get our gem installed in our project.

From here, navigate to your `spec_helper.rb` and near the top, add these lines:

```ruby
require 'simplecov'  
SimpleCov.start
```

All this says, is when we run our spec helper, we're going to need simpleCov so we can interact with it, and we immediately want to make simpleCov to begin monitoring our project.

That's it! From here all we need to do is call `rspec` \(or whatever test unit you are using\) in the terminal.

When we run our tests, simpleCov will create a report for us. The report is stored in a new folder within our rails project called coverage.

Running `open open coverage/index.html` should open the report for us, giving us our feedback.

If you need to know more about what has been analysed, clicking the magnifying glass icons will give you feedback on exactly what lines are not tested.

### Tracking test coverage <a id="tracking-test-coverage"></a>

Now obviously we have started to get lots and lots of tests. We need to start keeping track of our test coverage! Let's add a gem called [Simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov). Add this into your Gemfile \(again, in the test environment\) - `gem 'simplecov', :require => false, :group => :test`.

Then add, at the very top of your `rails_helper.rb` file, the following lines:

```ruby
require 'simplecov'
SimpleCov.start
```

```bash
bundle install
```

This will generate everything we need! Open up the **coverage/index.html** file in the browser and you will see everything that it tests.

```bash
open coverage/index.html
```

```bash
rails stats
```

## Singly Linked List <a id="singly-linked-list"></a>

Singly Linked Lists are a type of data structure. In a singly linked list, each node in the list stores the contents and a pointer or reference to the next node in the list. It does not store any pointer or reference to the previous node. ... The last node in a single linked list points to nothing.

```bash
mkdir singly_linked_list
cd singly_linked_list/
touch singly_linked_list.rb
```

```ruby
class SinglyLinkedList
​
end
​
require 'pry'
binding.pry
```

```ruby
# add a class into the SinglyLinkedList Class
​
class SinglyLinkedList
​
  class Node
​
  end
​
end
```

```ruby
class SinglyLinkedList
​
  class Node
​
  end
​
  attr_accessor :head
​
  def initialize
    @head = nil
  end
​
end
```

```ruby
class SinglyLinkedList
​
  class Node
​
  end
​
  attr_accessor :head
​
  def initialize
    @head = nil
  end
​
  def prepend(value)
    node = Node.new(value)
    node.next = @head
    @head = node
  end
​
end
```

```ruby
class Node
  attr_accessor :value, :next
​
  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
    @next = nil
  end
end
```

Now we can run the program to see how it works.

```bash
ruby singly_linked_list.rb
```

Our `binging.pry`will keep us in the program as well will have access to the class.

```bash
pry(main)> SinglyLinkedList=> SinglyLinkedList
```

We are now able to instantiate a new instance of the `SinglyLinkedList`.

```bash
pry(main)> bros = SinglyLinkedList.new
=> #<SinglyLinkedList:0x00007fc048a83148 @head=nil>
```

We can then call the `prepend` method we just created to add a new node.

```bash
pry(main)> bros.prepend 'Groucho'
=> #<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007fc0480c4d00 @next=nil, @value="Groucho">
```

This now have set the value of the head node to 'Groucho'.

```bash
pry(main)> bros
=> #<SinglyLinkedList:0x00007fc048a83148
 @head=#<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007fc0480c4d00 @next=nil, @value="Groucho">>
​
pry(main)> bros.head
=> #<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007fc0480c4d00 @next=nil, @value="Groucho">
​
pry(main)> bros.head.value
=> "Groucho"
```

Now if we were to add another Marx brother we will see that the head will change.

```bash
pry(main)> bros.prepend 'Harpo'
=> #<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007fc0490d9880
 @next=#<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007fc0480c4d00 @next=nil, @value="Groucho">,
 @value="Harpo">
​
pry(main)> bros
=> #<SinglyLinkedList:0x00007fc048a83148
 @head=
  #<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007fc0490d9880
   @next=#<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007fc0480c4d00 @next=nil, @value="Groucho">,
   @value="Harpo">>
​
pry(main)> bros.head.value
=> "Harpo"
```

We can see what the next head value or the previous node was.

```bash
pry(main)> bros.head.next.value
=> "Groucho"
```

As expected if you add another you can chain through to find the original node.

```bash
pry(main)> bros.prepend 'Zeppo'
=> #<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007fc04806c218
 @next=
  #<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007fc0490d9880
   @next=#<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007fc0480c4d00 @next=nil, @value="Groucho">,
   @value="Harpo">,
 @value="Zeppo">
​
pry(main)> bros.head.value
=> "Zeppo"
​
pry(main)> bros.head.next.value
=> "Harpo"
​
pry(main)> bros.head.next.next.value
=> "Groucho"
```

```bash
def initialize(value=nil)
  @head = Node.new(value) if value
end
```

Make a method that finds the last node.

```bash
def last
  node = @head
  while node && node.next
    node = node.next # Traverse by one to the next node in the list.
  end
  node
end

```

We can now set a new instance of the class as the next node of the last.

```bash
def append(value) # AKA .push
  last.next = Node.new(value)
end
```

Run the program again.

```bash
ruby singly_linked_list.rb
​
​
    36: end
    37:
    38:
    39:
    40: require 'pry'
 => 41: binding.pry
```

Create a new instance of the class.

```bash
pry(main)> bros = SinglyLinkedList.new 'Groucho'
=> #<SinglyLinkedList:0x00007ffd690683f8
 @head=#<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007ffd690683d0 @next=nil, @value="Groucho">>
​
pry(main)> bros.append 'harpo'
=> #<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007ffd68ad62f0 @next=nil, @value="harpo">
​
pry(main)> bros.append 'chico'
=> #<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007ffd68a85940 @next=nil, @value="chico">
​
pry(main)> bros.head.value
=> "Groucho"
​
pry(main)> bros.head.next
=> #<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007ffd68ad62f0
 @next=#<SinglyLinkedList::Node:0x00007ffd68a85940 @next=nil, @value="chico">,
 @value="harpo">
```

## Node.js <a id="node-js"></a>

​[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript engine that's mostly used to create web servers using JavaScript. It was written in 2009 by Ryan Dahl while he was working at Joyent.

### JavaScript engines​ <a id="javascript-engines"></a>

A JavaScript engine is a compiler that turns JavaScript into machine code for microprocessors - typically, it will turn it into things like:

* **IA32** - Intel Architecture 32 bit
* **x86-64** - A 64 bit version of the Intel Architecture
* **ARM** - Acorn Reduced Instruction Set Computing \(RISC\) Machine
* **MISP ISAs** - Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages Instruction Set Architecture

​Here are a few JavaScript engines: ​

* **SpiderMonkey** - Firefox, Netscape Navigator - the first JavaScript Engine
* **V8** - Chrome, Opera
* **Chakra** - Internet Explorer
* **Nitro** - Safari

**Node** is the V8 JavaScript engine, taken out of a browser, with a little bit extra. It lets us write server-side code in JavaScript, allowing us to do the same sorts of things we do with Ruby.

## _NodeJS - JavaScript Engines - Further Reading_ <a id="nodejs-javascript-engines-further-reading"></a>

* ​[Wikipedia - JavaScript Engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine#JavaScript_engines)​

## Why NodeJS? <a id="why-nodejs"></a>

### _What is Node good at?_ <a id="what-is-node-good-at"></a>

* Streaming data
* "Soft" real-time
* Every developer knows a bit of JS
* "Tooling"
* Unopinionated and flexible
* It can be isomorphic
* Corporate backing
* Performant
* Good community - easy to find developers

### _What is Node not so good at?​_ <a id="what-is-node-not-so-good-at"></a>

* "Tooling" - too much out there
* Being opinionated
* Memory leaks
* Dependency injection
* Serving static files \(like HTML\)
* Providing structure
* Generic JavaScript woes \(callbacks, etc.\)
* Allowing easy debugging
* Producing light-weight codebases
* Providing functionality out of the box
* Getting away from fancy buzzwords

## Installation and Usage <a id="installation-and-usage"></a>

### _Installation_ <a id="installation"></a>

```bash
# Initial installation using Homebrew
brew install node
# Upgrading installed version using Homebrew
brew upgrade node
```

### _Usage_ <a id="usage"></a>

```bash
# Open a Node REPL
node
# Run a Node application
node someFileName.js
```

## _NPM - Introduction_ <a id="npm-introduction"></a>

### Usage <a id="usage-1"></a>

We haven't gotten into Webpack yet, but this is an example of how we would create a new NodeJS application.

### _Initialize an NPM project_ <a id="initialize-an-npm-project"></a>

Running this command will create a package.json file for your NodeJS application. This describes your application, and allows NPM to manage your application's dependencies.

```bash
npm init
```

We can also skip the 'wizard'-style Q&A process with the -y flag.

```bash
npm init -y
```

### _Install packages_ <a id="install-packages"></a>

This will install Webpack and all its dependencies. The --save flag will also add webpack to your package.json.

```bash
npm install webpack --save
```

### _Update packages_ <a id="update-packages"></a>

Periodically, you should update the packages on which your application depends. This will update all local packages in your package.json file \(and all their dependencies\).

```bash
npm update
```

## Creating a simple Node server <a id="creating-a-simple-node-server"></a>

Create a new directory and cd into it then open in Atom.

```bash
mkdir simple-node-server
cd simple-node-server/
touch index.js
atom .
```

Add console log into the `index.js` file you've just created.

```javascript
console.log(`hello world`);
```

Run the program by using the below code in the terminal. Make sure you're in the `simple-node-server/` directory.

```bash
node index.js
```

You should be able to see the console log in the terminal `hello world.`

Go back to the `index.js` file and remove the console log as it was only used to make sure we have a connection. Define a variable and require 'http'

```javascript
const http = require('http');
```

Create a connection to the server with a 'fat arrow' function that way we can retain the value of `this`.

```javascript
http.createServer( (request, response) => {
​
});
```

This is a direct comparison of the old way of writing the function.

```javascript
http.createServer( function(request, response){
​
});
```

Because node is unopinionated we need to specify our requests and an end to the response.

```javascript
http.createServer( (request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'test/plain' }); //telling browser this is not HTML its just plain text.
  response.end('Hello World');
});
```

We also have to tell the server to start with a 'listen' promise chained to the end of the function. This will watch port 8000.

```javascript
http.createServer( (request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'test/plain' }); //telling browser this is not HTML its just plain text.
  response.end('Hello World');
}).listen(8000);
```

Unfortunately, Node doesn't log anything to the console so we have no way of knowing what's happening. We can get around this by placing console logs in our code.

```javascript
const http = require('http');
​
http.createServer( (request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'test/plain' }); //telling browser this is not HTML its just plain text.
  response.end('Hello World');
}).listen(8000);
​
console.log('Server now running at http://localhost:8000');
```

Now go back to the terminal an run the server

```javascript
node index.js
```

Add some additional logs to let us know when someone is trying to request a page.

```javascript
http.createServer( (request, response) => {
  console.log( 'Page requested');
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'test/plain' }); //telling browser this is not HTML its just plain text.
  response.end('Hello World');
}).listen(8000);
```
